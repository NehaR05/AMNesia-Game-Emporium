A friend in need is a friend indeed!
Learning Python is an amazing experience, that I am looking forward to.
Keep smiling, because life is a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.
Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.
As if you were on fire from within. The moon lives in the lining of your skin.
In nature, nothing is perfect and everything is perfect.
Life is full of beauty. Notice it.
Time spent amongst trees is never wasted time.
Going to the mountains is like going home.
If you truly love nature, you will find beauty everywhere.
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor.
Just one small positive thought in the morning can change your whole day.
Opportunities don't happen, you create them.
Love your family, work super hard, live your passion.
It is never too late to be what you might have been.
