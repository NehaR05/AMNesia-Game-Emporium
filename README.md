# Description
The AMNesia Game Emporium is a combination of three all-time favorite games: 

1. Rock, Paper, Scissors
2. Number Memory Game
3. Typing Test 

Rock, Paper, Scissors: 
Users compete against each other, or against the system in 3 rounds of this classic playground game to answer this age-old question: "Who is the Rock, Paper, Scissors Champion?"

Number Memory Game:
Beat the other users in remembering the longest series of numbers to earn your spot on the prestigious leaderboard.

Typing Test:
We're in the 21st century. Even a baby can type up their favorite cartoon on YouTube. But who can do it the fastest? Race against the clock in this cut-throat game of typing--and try not to lose any fingers in the process!


Our project, being related to games, takes advantage of the Python tkinter module to add all essential visual effects. We've also demonstrated technical experience in using multiple other Python modules to enhance the user experience. Welcome to AMNesia Game Emporium. Your entertainment is our top priotity!
